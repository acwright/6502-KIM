6502-CRT
========

A 6502 assembly language cartridge template for the [A.C. Wright 6502 project](https://github.com/acwright/6502).

## Overview

Cartridges for this system overlay the ROM address space from `$C000–$FFFF`, replacing the Monitor, BASIC interpreter, Wozmon, and CPU vectors with custom code. The Kernal (`$A000–$B7FF`) and character set (`$B800–$BFFF`) remain accessible, providing hardware initialization, character I/O, video, sound, storage, and other system services through a stable jump table.

### How It Works

1. The cartridge ROM physically overrides the BIOS ROM in the `$C000–$FFFF` range
2. The CPU fetches the RESET vector from `$FFFC–$FFFD` — now supplied by the cartridge
3. The cartridge's reset handler calls `KernalInit` (`$A072`) to initialize all hardware
4. After init, the cartridge takes full control — display its own UI, run its program, etc.

### Memory Layout

| Range | Contents |
|-------|----------|
| `$0000–$7FFF` | RAM (32 KB — zero page, stack, input buffer, variables, program space) |
| `$8000–$9FFF` | I/O hardware registers (directly addressable) |
| `$A000–$A0FF` | **Kernal jump table** — stable API entry points (available to cartridges) |
| `$A100–$BFFF` | Kernal implementation + character set (available to cartridges) |
| `$C000–$FFF9` | **Cartridge ROM** — your code goes here |
| `$FFFA–$FFFF` | **CPU vectors** — NMI, RESET, IRQ (supplied by cartridge) |

### Kernal Services

After calling `KernalInit`, the full Kernal jump table is available. Key entry points:

| Address | Routine | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `$A078` | `KernalInit` | Initialize all hardware; caller must reset stack pointer first. Returns via RTS (no CLI, no splash) |
| `$A07B` | `KernalVersion` | Get BIOS version (A=major, X=minor) |
| `$A000` | `Chrout` | Output character (routed by IO_MODE) |
| `$A003` | `Chrin` | Read character from input buffer |
| `$A030` | `Beep` | Play startup beep (skips if no SID) |
| `$A018` | `VideoClear` | Clear screen and reset cursor |
| `$A01E` | `VideoSetCursor` | Set cursor position (X=col, Y=row) |
| `$A00F` | `SetIOMode` | Set console output mode (A=0 video, A=1 serial) |

See `6502.inc` for the complete jump table and hardware register definitions.

### Interrupt Handling

The cartridge owns the hardware vectors at `$FFFA–$FFFF`. The template uses trampoline routines that jump through the RAM-based vectors (`IRQ_PTR` at `$0300`, `NMI_PTR` at `$0304`) which `KernalInit` sets to the default Kernal handlers. This means:

- **Keyboard input works out of the box** — the default IRQ handler processes keyboard scancodes
- **Custom IRQ handling** — override `IRQ_PTR` after `KernalInit` to install your own handler
- **Direct vectors** — alternatively, point the hardware vector directly at your handler (bypasses the RAM indirection)

### Hardware Detection

After `KernalInit`, read `HW_PRESENT` (`$030D`) to discover installed hardware:

```asm
lda HW_PRESENT
and #HW_VID            ; Is video card present?
beq @NoVideo           ; Skip video-specific code if not
```

## Building

### Prerequisites

#### CC65 Compiler

On macOS, install via Homebrew:
```bash
brew install cc65
```

For other platforms, see the [cc65 project](https://github.com/cc65/cc65).

#### Optional: minipro (for EEPROM burning)

```bash
brew install minipro
```

### Build Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `make` | Build the cartridge ROM (`Cart.crt`) |
| `make view` | Display hexdump of the built ROM |
| `make eeprom` | Write the ROM to an AT28C256 EEPROM via TL866 programmer |
| `make clean` | Remove build artifacts |

### Build Output

```bash
make
```

Produces:
- `Cart.crt` — 32 KB ROM image (`$8000–$FFFF`), ready to burn to a 28C256 or 27C256 PROM
- `Cart.lst` — Assembly listing file for debugging

### Programming the EEPROM

```bash
make eeprom
```

Burns `Cart.crt` to an AT28C256 EEPROM using a TL866-compatible programmer and minipro.

## Template Structure

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Cart.asm` | Main cartridge source — entry point, example code, vectors |
| `6502.inc` | System include file — Kernal jump table, hardware registers, constants |
| `6502.cfg` | Linker configuration — memory layout for cartridge ROM |
| `Makefile` | Build system |

## Customizing

1. Edit `Cart.asm` — replace the example code after `cli` with your program
2. The `CartReset` label is called on power-on; `KernalInit` is already called for you
3. Add additional `.asm` files and `.include` them from `Cart.asm` as needed
4. The cartridge has ~16 KB of ROM space (`$C000–$FFF9`) for code and data
